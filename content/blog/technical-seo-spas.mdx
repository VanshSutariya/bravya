Search engines have caught up with modern JavaScript, but that doesn’t excuse us from doing the fundamentals right.

## Server render critical paths

Hybrid rendering with Next.js App Router lets us stream above-the-fold content while deferring non-critical chunks.

```tsx
// app/(marketing)/layout.tsx
export const dynamic = 'force-static';
export const revalidate = 3600;
```

## Own your structured data

We ship JSON-LD for each template—organization, breadcrumbs, product/case studies, and blog posts. When you control the schema, you control the narrative.

## Invest in sitemaps & monitoring

Regenerate sitemaps as content changes and watch Google Search Console for anomalies. Pair it with a crawl of prerendered pages each release.
