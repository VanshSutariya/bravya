Before a new API endpoint exits feature flags, it must clear our hardening checklist.

## Authentication & authorization

Enforce zero-trust controls. Every handler should validate identity and scopes, no exceptions.

## Guard rails

- **Rate limiting:** implement token bucket or sliding window algorithms per consumer.
- **Schema validation:** fail fast with zod or similar to keep undefined behavior out of production.
- **Circuit breaking:** prevent downstream outages from cascading by shedding traffic gracefully.

```ts
import { z } from 'zod';

const payloadSchema = z.object({
  userId: z.string().uuid(),
  email: z.string().email(),
});

type Payload = z.infer<typeof payloadSchema>;
```

## Observability

Structured logging, metrics, and distributed tracing arenâ€™t nice-to-haves. Wire them into dashboards with alerting tuned to business impact.
