Next.js 14 is a sweet spot for enterprise delivery: predictable builds, hybrid rendering, and a vibrant ecosystem.

## Server-first mental model

Server Components reduce client bundle bloat and make data requirements obvious. We combine them with RSC-friendly utilities and shared fetchers.

## Edge-ready from the start

Streaming, partial prerendering, and middleware let us squeeze latency without over-engineering bespoke infrastructure.

## Better DX == faster value

When teams trust the tooling (TypeScript, Turbopack, linting), they ship more confidently. Next.js fits well with our testing, observability, and deployment playbooks.
