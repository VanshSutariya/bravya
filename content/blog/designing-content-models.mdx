Content modeling is collaboration. Marketers need flexibility while engineers need predictability. We bridge the gap with a few principles.

## Model the experience, not the page

Start with journeys and reuse patterns. Define atoms (copy blocks, CTA groups) that can be remixed across templates.

## Governance from day one

Version content models in code. Use automated migrations so environments stay in sync.

```ts
export const heroSection = defineDocumentType(() => ({
  name: 'Hero',
  fields: {
    eyebrow: { type: 'string', required: true },
    headline: { type: 'string', required: true },
    ctas: { type: 'list', of: { type: 'string' } },
  },
}));
```

## Document editorial workflows

Draft → review → publish pipelines with notifications keep everyone aligned. We customize dashboards so stakeholders know exactly what’s shipping next.
