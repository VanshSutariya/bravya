## Engagement snapshot

We formed a tiger team with compliance, product, and CX. By replaying user sessions and auditing verification APIs, we pinpointed friction patterns and data gaps.

## What we delivered

- Built adaptive flows powered by feature flags to trial verification vendors safely.
- Exposed real-time status dashboards for customer success using Kafka streams.
- Automated regression suites simulating a spectrum of identity documents.

## Outcomes
