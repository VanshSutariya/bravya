description: 'Unified carrier visibility and predictive ETA intelligence for a global 3PL operating across 14 markets.'
date: '2024-03-28'
problem: 'Fragmented carrier portals and manual spreadsheets created blind spots in customs clearance and last-mile handoffs, inflating dwell time and penalty fees.'
approach: 'We orchestrated a digital control tower on top of an event-driven data mesh, blending live telematics, OMS data, and predictive modelling surfaced through a command-center UI.'
stack:
  - Next.js
  - NestJS
  - GraphQL
  - Azure Event Hubs
  - Tailwind CSS
  - Power BI Embedded
outcomes:
  - 'On-time, in-full (OTIF) performance improved by 19% ahead of peak season.'
  - 'Carrier reconciliation time dropped from 36 hours to under 4 hours per lane.'
  - 'Operations leaders receive 45% fewer ad-hoc status calls each week.'

## Engagement snapshot

We embedded with the client's network operations center and finance controllers to catalogue every SLA breach scenario. Workshops with regional carriers helped align telemetry contracts and data refresh cadences.

## What we delivered

- Established a canonical shipment timeline model synchronised via Azure Event Hubs.
- Launched a React-based command center with predictive ETA insights and lane-level heat maps.
- Automated charge reconciliation by reconciling carrier EDI events with customs releases and warehouse scans.

## Outcomes

The control tower provides a single operating picture for planners, finance, and customer teams. Exceptions surface proactively, enabling decisive interventions before downstream costs accrue.
