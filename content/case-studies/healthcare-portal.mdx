## Engagement snapshot

The healthcare organization needed a modern experience without compromising compliance. Our cross-functional squad embedded with security, clinical operations, and support to map requirements and failure modes.

## What we delivered

- Introduced incremental static regeneration with background revalidation for health records.
- Automated end-to-end tests covering high-risk journeys, including screen reader regression checks.
- Configured observability for API health with dashboards and runbooks for on-call rotations.

## Outcomes

With improved resiliency and accessibility, patient satisfaction scores rose sharply. Support teams reported a 40% reduction in escalations, freeing bandwidth for proactive outreach programs.
