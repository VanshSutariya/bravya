## Engagement snapshot

We partnered with a remote product team to stabilize their dashboard experience ahead of a major pricing launch. Structured discovery uncovered brittle data pipelines, untyped components, and missing accessibility coverage.

## What we delivered

- Introduced streaming dashboards with server-side GraphQL resolvers and edge caching.
- Automated visual regression testing to prevent UI drift across 14 locales.
- Paired with internal designers to codify tokens and states into a consumable design system package.

## Outcomes

The product team shipped the new dashboards two sprints earlier than forecast. Support tickets tied to reporting fell by 63%, and the company unlocked enterprise upsells with confidence.
